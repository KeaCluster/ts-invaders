## About

Space invaders but with TypeScript

- Vanilla TS practice
- Refactor and migration from [og project](https://github.com/KeaCluster/spaceInvaders) from a few years back
- Overdue
- Might keep it simple and clean
- Might not and add more stuff

## To do

1. Some shared methods can be refactored
2. Maybe an algorithm to make enemies appear with a pyramid-like internal structure
   * Something like heavy infantry at the center or stuff like that.
3. Levels
   * Algorithm should adjust to levels
   * What the [] am I even saying
4. lmao this is delusional

## Idk

Copy it or just check out the code, do your thing.

## Clause

I do not own the Space Invaders IP.

If you copy my code you will have to buy me a beer if we ever meet in person.
