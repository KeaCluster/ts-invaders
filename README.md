## About

Space invaders but with TypeScript

- TS + Canvas

## To do

1. Some shared methods can be refactored
2. Maybe an algorithm to make enemies appear with a pyramid-like internal structure
   - Something like heavy infantry at the center or stuff like that.
3. Levels
   - Algorithm should adjust to levels
   - What the [] am I even saying

## How to

Clone it or just check out the code, do your thing.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/KeaCluster/ts-invaders.git

cd ts-invaders

npm init

npm run dev

```

## Clause

I do not own the Space Invaders IP.
If you copy my code you will have to buy me a beer if we ever meet in person.
