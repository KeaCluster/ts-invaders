## About

Space invaders but with TypeScript

- Vanilla TS practice
- Refactor and migration from [og project](https://github.com/KeaCluster/spaceInvaders) from a few years back
- Overdue
- Might keep it simple and clean
- Might not and add more stuff

## To do

1. Some shared methods can be refactored

## Idk

Copy it or just check out the code, do your thing.

## Clause

I do not own the Space Invaders IP.

If you copy my code you will have to buy me a beer if we ever meet in person.
